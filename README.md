#MCLauncher

An customizable minecraft launcher for Mac OSX and Linux


##Instruction

This is an Java project developed using Intellij Idea. So, I prefer to use it instead of eclipse on your development.

To export an executable jar file, please click 

	Build -> Build Artifacts .. -> Build
	
The jar file should be under 
	
	Project folder\out\artifacts\MCLauncher\

Double click "MCLauncher.jar" to execute the launcher.
